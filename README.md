# IA_Flask

About this Course

This mini course is intended to apply basic Python skills for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled applications. In this hands-on project you will assume the role of a developer and perform tasks including:  
- Develop functions and application logic 
- Exchange data using Watson AI libraries
- Write unit tests, and 
- Package the application for distribution. 

You will demonstrate your foundational Python skills by employing different techniques to develop web applications and AI powered solutions. After completing this course, you will have added another project to your portfolio and gained the confidence to begin developing AI enabled applications using Python and Flask, Watson AI libraries, build and run unit tests, and package the application for distribution out in the real world.
